                <h2>Enna Alouette</h2>
                <p>The vtuber that currently sits on the top of my list.
                    Her humour and comfy style of streaming is what caught my eye.
                    The stories she tells about her life is also very interesting
                    and humbling. She shows a very kind heart in these stories and
                    I love her for it!

                <h2>Luca Kaneshiro</h2>
                <p>The first vtuber that my best friend introduced to me and
                    I loved him because of his puppy-like aura. He immediately
                    makes me smile with his silliness and antics. I also admire
                    him for his dedication to his physical health as it makes me
                    motivated to work out more too!

                <h2>Doppio Dropscythe</h2>
                <p>A recent edition to my oshi list is D- for DOPPIOOOO. Actually third place
                    is hard to place because I like most equally in this position, but
                    for now I'll let Pio-chan have the spot. I like how he cooks and doesn't
                    care how weird he sounds. He is fully himself and that's only something I can
                    hope to exude as well.
